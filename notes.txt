We must add express everytime we make a new project

1. first type this in your command line:

npm init -y

(You should get a file called package.json and package-lock.json in the directory you ran this command in)
    (Basically a file that tells your computer how to run your express stuff)
    (DO NOT TOUCH THEM! They were made by experts!)

2. THEN run this

npm install express

3. Install nodemon for live, proper updates

npm install nodemon --save-dev

4. Modify the "Scripts" section in package.json, with this below "Start"

"dev": "nodemon server.js"

You should be good to go after this
